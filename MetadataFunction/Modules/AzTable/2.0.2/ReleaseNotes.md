# Release Notes

## Version 2.0.2
* Implemented ContinuationToken logic while using ExecuteQuerySegmentedAsync to get more than 1000 rows.

## Version 2.0.1
* This module now depends on Az.Storage, Az.Authentication and Az.Resources Powershell modules, this version of the module will not work anymore with AzureRM. 
* A major change happened on SDK side and assembly Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage is now replaced by Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos assembly.
* Moved from sync to async methods to perform query operations. Kudos to [jakedenyer](https://github.com/jakedenyer) for his contributions in this space.
* Noun "AzureStorageTable" got replaced by "AzTable" but aliases are being provided for compatibility. Notice that for automatic module load, you need to use the new noun, for the old noun, you must import the module before using a cmdlet.
* All Get cmdlets got deprecated and Get-AzTableRow must be used moving forward, they are still available but they are calling Get-AzTableRow behind the scenes and will be removed in a future release.

## Version 1.0.0.23
* Added parameter UpdateExisting to Add-StorageTableRow so if a row already exists you can update its content in a single operation 

## Version 1.0.0.22
* Removed support for Cosmos DB Tables since it will have its own module

## Version 1.0.0.21
* Azure Storage Table automatic Timestamp system column is now renamed to TableTimestamp in order to avoid conflict with a possible (very possible) existence of Timestamp included by applications as an entity's property. 
* Cmdlet Add-StorageTableRow now has the property parameter as an optional parameter
* Get-AzureStorageTableRowByColumnName cmdlet now supports guid values throught the guidValue parameter

## Version 1.0.0.20

* Very minor update, changed a variable name on Get-AzureStorageTableTable function

## Version 1.0.0.18

* Fixed a bug with the Get-AzureStorageTableTable function where it was returning two objects, a boolean and the cloudtable when using Cosmos DB.

## Version 1.0.0.16

* Removed extra query to the table when updating an entity in order to be able to make optimistic locking work (it will trigger error 412 if someone else changed the entity), for locking mechanism, please refer to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/managing-concurrency-in-microsoft-azure-storage-2/
